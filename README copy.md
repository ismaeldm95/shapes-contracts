# Shapes Game - Starknet
A daily shapes-based puzzle game built on Starknet using Cairo 1.0. Players solve geometric puzzles by finding valid combinations of shapes that match the daily challenge.

## Overview

‘The Shapes Game is a smart contract-based puzzle where:
Each day presents a new set of compound shapes

Players must find valid combinations of basic shapes that match the target
Scores are recorded on-chain

Players can only attempt each daily puzzle once

## Prerequisites

= [Scarb] (https: //docs.swnansion.com/scarb/) (Cairo package manager)
= [Starknet Foundry] (https: //foundry-rs.github. 10/starknet-foundry/)
= [Cairo 1.0](https://cairo-lang.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shapes-game-starknet

ed shapes-game-starknet

2. Install dependencies

bash

scarb install

## Building

Build the project using Scarb:

bash

scarb build

## Testing

Run the test suite using Starknet Foundry:

bash

snforge test

‘## Game Rules

1. Each day presents a new set of compound shapes
2. Players get multiple attempts to solve each shape

3. Each solution must use unique basic shapes

4, Solutions are scored based on efficiency and correctness
5. Players can only submit one solution per day

## Smart Contract Interface

### Key Functions

Submit a solution for the current shape.

cairo

fn getCompoundShape(game_id: felt252, shape_index: u8) -> Array<u8>

Get the compound shape for a specific game and index.

cairo

fn getPlayerScore(player: ContractAddress, game_i

Get a player's score for a specific game.

## Development

### Running Local Tests

bash

Run all tests

snforge test

Run specific test
snforge test test_solve_shape

### Deployment

1. Build the contract:
bash
scarb build

2. Deploy using Starknet CLI:
bash

starknet deploy --contract target/dev/shapes_game.sierra.json
